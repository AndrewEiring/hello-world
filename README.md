New ideas and resources

Hi Everyone!

This is Andrew, I'm currently in the process of looking for new opportunities to advance my career in IT Support. I'm learning how to code and just enrolled in Harvard's CX50 via edx to learn more. 
I'm from Florida and have a 2 year old son who is currently learning how to skateboard from his old man. We're on a seach for Animal Chin :)
